Midge is a lightweight framework for digital signal analysis, written in the following spirit:


There is an island,
  an island which you cannot go beyond.
It is a place of nothingness,
  a place of non-posession,
  and of non-attachment.
  
It is the total end of death and decay,

  and this is why I call it 'Nibbana'.
